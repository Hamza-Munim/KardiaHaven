          <h2 class="nameheading"><a href="">Paul Smith</a></h2>
          <p>Managing Partner</p>
          <p>
            “Running a restaurant is all about taking care of people,” says Paul
            Kirby who has been at the helm of KARDIA HAVEN since 2000. “From
            your staff to each and every guest that comes into your
            establishment, it is important to make everyone feel comfortable and
            welcome. Restaurant employees that are valued and respected take
            pride in their work and truly enjoy their jobs. This translates
            directly to the guest experience.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While Paul may be soft-spoken and charming (qualities he attributes
            to his Southern upbringing), he is extremely driven. His dedicated,
            hands-on approach to management ensures the high standards of
            service and hospitality at the restaurant have stayed consistent for
            over 15 years. Under Kirby, Kanva’s refreshing approach to service
            emphasizes the emotional elements of hospitality: Have a good time
            and above all, make sure the guests have a great time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Paul came to the West Coast after years managing waterfront
            restaurant properties in The Hamptons outside of New York City. His
            first job in San Francisco was working alongside acclaimed, Bay Area
            Chef, Reed Hearon as General Manager of Rose Pistola. After three
            years with Hearon he came to KARDIA HAVEN bringing with him a
            genuine appreciation and knowledge of rustic Meditteranean cuisine
            and wines, an essential prerequisite for working at KARDIA. In 2006
            he was named Managing Partner of both KARDIA and Evvia in Palo Alto.

          <h2 class="nameheading"><a href="">Erik Cosselmon</a></h2>
          <p>Chef Partner</p>
          <p>
            Erik Cosselmon’s wide-ranging Mediterranean repertoire and strong,
            ingredient-driven style finds full expression in the Greek-inspired
            menus at KARDIA and sister restaurant Evvia in Palo Alto. Since
            being named Executive Chef of KARDIA in 2004, Cosselmon’s brand of
            casual tavern cuisine has attracted even more devotees, earning
            KARDIA top ratings in both local and National press publications.
            “The goal at KARDIA and Evvia is to offer as close to a true Greek
            restaurant experience as possible. Not only is it about good food,
            it’s about the people, the celebratory atmosphere and the Greek
            hospitality.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Erik grew up on a farm in Central Michigan helping his mom tend
            their extensive kitchen garden and his dad cook for the large
            parties the family would host. This introduction to farm-fresh
            ingredients and cooking cemented his desire to be a chef at an early
            age. After completing a degree at The Culinary Institute of America
            in Hyde Park, New York he moved to Manhattan and began his career
            working at notable restaurants such as Montrachet, Tribeca Grill, Le
            Bernardin and Daniel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cosselmon moved to San Francisco and in 1996 joined Reed Hearon in
            opening his landmark Liqurian restaurant, Rose Pistola, in North
            Beach. In 1998 he was named Executive Chef. In 2001, ready for a new
            challenge, Erik left to run the kitchen at Cetrella Bistro & Café in
            Half Moon Bay where he garnered immediate and consistent critical
            praise for his rustic Mediterranean food
          </p>
          <p>
            His subsequent move to KARDIA made perfect sense. “Since moving from
            New York to the Bay Area, my cooking philosophy has evolved from the
            formal French tradition to the less complicated Mediterranean, with
            a focus on ingredients as opposed to the architecture of the dish.”
            His leadership and cuisine has contributed to Kanva’s extraordinary
            success as one of San Francisco’s busiest restaurants. In 2006,
            Cosselmon was named Executive Chef of sister restaurant Evvia
            located in Palo Alto where he oversees the menu. He also joined the
            founding Partners as a Partner.

          <h2 class="nameheading"><a href="">Mario Ortega</a></h2>
          <p>Executive Chef</p>
          <p>
            Chef Mario Ortega’s interest in food and cooking began at a young
            age. He would spend hours in the kitchen with his grandma observing
            and helping her cook and tasting the delicious dishes she created.
            This ignited a lifelong passion for food that shaped his adult life.
          </p>
          <p>
            After attending culinary school at Leaderwolf Academy in Sacramento,
            Chef Mario was brought to California’s culinary mecca, San
            Francisco. During his time in SF, Mario worked hard to develop his
            craft at high end restaurants such as Vertigo in the famous
            TransAmerica building and Scala’s Bistro. He spent several years at
            Scala’s nourishing his love for Mediterranean cooking. In 2005 he
            left the city for an opportunity to head the kitchen at Quail Lodge
            Resort in Carmel. In 2006 Mario joined the culinary team at KARDIA
            HAVEN as Chef de Cuisine. The modern Hellenic cuisine was a great
            fit for his Mediterranean-focused background. Two years later he
            assumed the role of Executive Chef at Evvia, Kanva’s sister
            restaurant in Palo Alto.
          </p>
          <p>
            After 15 years at Evvia HAVEN, Mario returned to KARDIA in the
            Summer of 2023 to assume the roll of Executive Chef. During his time
            at Evvia he developed close relationships with many local purveyors.
            At KARDIA, he continues to foster these relationships and focus on
            creating Mediterranean-inspired dishes from locally sourced products
            whenever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Chef is not at the helm at Evvia, he adores spending time with
            his wife and three children and it usually involves food!
